		<h3>The Work</h3>
		<p>In 2011, Paak had started earning acceptance in the Los Angeles music world, and had begun working on his debut album. Shafiq Husayn of Sa-Ra helped Paak recover financially from losing his job in Santa Barbara by employing him as an assistant, videographer, editor, writer, and producer. He completed O.B.E. Vol.1, and released the album in mid-2012. He became the drummer for American Idol contestant Haley Reinhart. In November 27, 2013, Paak produced and recorded Cover Art, an all-covers EP. Paak was inspired by the white artists of the 1950s who achieved commercial success by remaking songs written by black blues and RnB singers while hardly ever compensating the original artists. Cover Art reversed the process and transformed folk and rock classics from white musicians into a mold of soul, jazz, hip hop, and RnB. The album was released by the independent Hellfyre Club and OBE labels.On October 28, 2014, Paak released Venice, his debut album as Anderson Paak, on OBE and Steel Wool. In October 2015, he announced that he has recorded material with ScHoolboy Q and 9th Wonder. Paak plans to release a new album, Malibu, on January 15th, 2016<h5>Source from andersonpaak.com/</h5></p>
