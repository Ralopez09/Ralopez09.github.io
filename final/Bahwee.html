		<h3>The Work</h3>
		<p> BAHWEE, the L.A. native and beat-maker extraordinaire, is back with a new project. This time he has decided to go back and compile a mix of all his older tracks and has called his album SKETCHES. If you are unfamiliar with BAHWEE, then you can prepare yourself for very minimalistic beats with a hip-hop center and soul. And, it looks like BAHWEE may be heading in a different direction, after this mix, because his next project entitled The Gap is right around the corner and he has stated it will be completely different than work heâ€™s done in the past. So, for now check out SKETCHES which is in familiar territory but dope nonetheless and keep a look out for THE GAP, out on Huh What and Where, soon after. Enjoy.<h5>Source from earmilk.com</h5></p>
